# A1-Cloud-Computing
The repo for the first assignment of Cloud Computing
## Objective
This assignment will provide you with experience developing a web application using python and flask. You will also get experience deploying and running your application on Amazon EC2.

## Description
In this assignment you will develop a web application for storing and browsing photographs.

Your application should support the following functionality:

A welcome page that lets returning users authenticate and enables new users to create new accounts.
A home page that lets authenticated users browse thumbnails of their photos. Use the popular ImageMagick tool to create thumbnails.
An option for uploading a new photo.
After a new image is uploaded, your application should automatically create 3 different transformations (e.g, scale down, enlarge, black and white, sepia). Use the popular ImageMagick tool to transform the image. It is up to you to decide what transformations to implement.
Clicking on a photo's thumbnail should produce the full resolution version of the photo as well as its transformations.
